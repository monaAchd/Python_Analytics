# Python Analysis Repository

Welcome to the "Python Analysis" repository! This repository is a compilation of various Python projects and analyses covering different domains. Each project addresses specific tasks, challenges, or data analysis scenarios. Below is an overview of the projects included:

## Projects:

### 1. **Age Classifier:**
   - A Python program that classifies individuals into different age groups based on user input.
   - Unit tests included for robustness and correctness.

### 2. **Triangle Classifier:**
   - A program that reads the lengths of the sides of a triangle and classifies it as equilateral, isosceles, or irregular.
   - Includes unit tests for three different triangle scenarios.

### 3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:**
   - An interactive program that allows users to play the classic rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.
   - Unit tests ensure the correctness of game logic.

### 4. **Webpages Analysis with Robot Framework:**
   - Utilizes the Robot Framework to perform tests on webpages, including reading information from a text file, pinging addresses, and capturing IP and ping time.

### 5. **Shop Satisfaction Survey Data Analysis:**
   - Conducts systematic analysis of Shop Satisfaction Survey Data using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
