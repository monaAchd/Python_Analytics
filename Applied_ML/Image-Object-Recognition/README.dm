## Step:

### 1. Download the Code

- Visit the provided Google Drive link: [Code for Image Classification](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rp4k0b85am7jLxr-yCGmu74Qx8VyS-mq).
- Download the relevant code files and any associated files or models.

### 2. Study the Code

- Go through the code files and understand the structure, functions, and overall workflow.
- Identify the image classification models used in the code.

### 3. Set Up the Environment

- Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. This may include Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or any other specified in the code.

### 4. Run the Code

- Execute the code on your local machine. Follow any instructions or guidelines provided in the code comments or documentation.

### 5. Collect Test Dataset

- Collect a small test dataset. Ensure diversity by having 3-4 categories with 50 images in each category.

### 6. Modify Code for Test Dataset

- If the code is specifically designed for a certain dataset, modify it to handle your test dataset. This may involve adjusting input sizes, labels, or paths.

### 7. Run Tests with Different Models

- Run the code with three different image classification models. Observe the results and check for any errors.

### 8. Examine Recognition Results

- Analyze the recognition results for each model. Note the accuracy and misclassifications.

### 9. Generate Confusion Matrix

- Create a confusion matrix to gain insights into how well each class is recognized and identify misclassifications.

### 10. Justify Model Choices

- Based on the results, justify which type of models you would choose for further development. Consider factors like accuracy, interpretability, and suitability for the task.
