# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification with PCA and Kernel PCA

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification project with PCA and Kernel PCA! In this project, we are enhancing the notebook from "SVL-model" folder, utilizing the same dataset sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## Objectives

1. **Quick Recap of the Dataset:**
   - Briefly revisit what the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is all about, emphasizing key features and the context of the data.

2. **Prediction Target (Label Variable):**
   - Reiterate and clarify the variable we are predicting, specifically in the context of breast cancer diagnostics.

3. **Usage of StandardScaler:**
   - Study the use of StandardScaler in the context of PCA and Kernel PCA. Address whether it was used and if so, where in the process.

4. **Models Trained:**
   - Outline the classification models trained in the notebook.

5. **PCA Implementation:**
   - Introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its implementation in the notebook.

6. **Kernel PCA Implementation:**
   - Implement Kernel PCA in the modeling process.

7. **GridSearchCV for Kernel PCA:**
   - Run GridSearchCV with different hyperparameter values for Kernel PCA to find the best model.

8. **Model Selection Criteria:**
   - Explain the criteria used to choose the best model among the experimented ones.
