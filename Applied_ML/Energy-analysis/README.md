# Regression Modeling on Dataset

Welcome to the Regression Modeling Project! In this project, we are conducting a regression analysis on the dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository:: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency.

## Objectives

1. **Understanding the Dataset:**
   - Explore and describe what the dataset is all about. Understand the features, their meanings, and the context of the data.

2. **Prediction Target (Label Variable):**
   - Clearly define and identify the variable we are predicting, often referred to as the label variable.

3. **Training Plain Linear Regression Model:**
   - Implement and train a simple linear regression model using the data.

4. **Training Polynomial Models:**
   - Explore and train polynomial regression models. 

5. **Utilizing the Dataset:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Discuss the rationale behind this partitioning and how it contributes to model evaluation.

6. **Lasso Regularization:**
   - Implement Lasso regularization to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

7. **Checking Parameter Values:**
   - Examine and document the parameter values obtained for the regression model.

8. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Investigate whether Lasso regularization resulted in the practical filtering out of certain features. 

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Exploration:**
   - Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents.

2. **Label Variable Definition:**
   - Define the variable we are predicting in the regression model.

3. **Linear Regression Modeling:**
   - Train a plain linear regression model on the dataset.

4. **Polynomial Regression Modeling:**
   - Experiment with polynomial regression models of different degrees.

5. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for effective model evaluation.

6. **Lasso Regularization Implementation:**
   - Apply Lasso regularization to improve the model's performance.

7. **Parameter Examination:**
   - Examine the parameter values obtained for the regression model, especially after regularization.

8. **Feature Filtering Analysis:**
   - Investigate if any features were practically filtered out due to Lasso regularization.
