# Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification project! In this project, we are building a classification model using the dataset sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## Objectives

1. **Understanding the Dataset:**
   - Explore and describe what the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is all about. Understand the features, their meanings, and the context of the data.

2. **Prediction Target (Label Variable):**
   - Clearly define and identify the variable we are predicting, specifically in the context of breast cancer diagnostics.

3. **StandardScaler Implementation:**
   - Utilize StandardScaler to standardize the feature values. Investigate its impact on classification performance compared to models trained without it.

4. **Model Training without StandardScaler:**
   - Initially, train classification models without using StandardScaler to observe the baseline performance.

5. **Model Training with StandardScaler:**
   - Train classification models after applying StandardScaler to the dataset. Observe potential improvements in classification rates.

6. **Model Selection:**
   - Experiment with various classification models and algorithms.

7. **Best Model Selection Criteria:**
   - Discuss the criteria used to choose the best classification model among the experimented ones.

8. **Utilizing the Dataset:**
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for effective model evaluation.

9. **C Value Variation:**
   - Build classification models with different values of C (the regularization parameter).

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Exploration:**
   - Explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents.

2. **Label Variable Definition:**
   - Clearly define the variable we are predicting in the classification model, focusing on breast cancer diagnostics.

3. **StandardScaler Application:**
   - Apply StandardScaler to standardize feature values.

4. **Model Training without StandardScaler:**
   - Build classification models without using StandardScaler.

5. **Model Training with StandardScaler:**
   - Train classification models after applying StandardScaler.

6. **Model Experimentation:**
   - Experiment with various classification models and algorithms.

7. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose the best classification model based on evaluation metrics.

8. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for effective model evaluation.

9. **C Value Variation:**
   - Explore the impact of different values of C on classification model performance.
