# Shop Satisfaction Survey Data Analysis

In this project, I will perform a meaningful analysis of the Shop Satisfaction Survey Data using Python along with essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal is to provide insightful information. Here's what I learned and implemented:

## Learning Objectives

1. **Analyze Data Systematically:**
   - Employ Python, Pandas, and NumPy to perform systematic data analysis.

2. **Explore Variable Data Visually:**
   - Utilize Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations that provide insights into the data.

3. **Explore Variable Data with Means and Standard Deviations:**
   - Calculate means and standard deviations to understand the central tendency and variability of the data.

4. **Study Two Categorical Variables Together:**
   - Categorize numerical variables appropriately before studying them together.
   - Apply techniques to analyze relationships between two categorical variables.

5. **Learn Statistical Tests (Chi-Square):**
   - Understand the importance of statistical tests in data analysis.
   - Implement the Chi-Square test for analyzing the independence of categorical variables.

6. **Making Interpretations for Your Analysis:**
   - Develop the skills to interpret the results of your analysis accurately.

7. **Presenting Findings:**
   - Learn how to effectively communicate your analysis results to stakeholders, including your boss.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading:**
   - Load the Shop Satisfaction Survey Data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

3. **Visual Analysis:**
   - Create meaningful visualizations to provide insights into the survey data.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate means and standard deviations for relevant variables.

5. **Categorical Variable Analysis:**
   - Study the relationships between two categorical variables using appropriate techniques.

6. **Statistical Testing:**
   - Implement the Chi-Square test to determine the independence of categorical variables.

7. **Interpretation and Conclusions:**
   - Formulate clear interpretations based on the analysis results.

8. **Presentation Preparation:**
   - Organize your findings and prepare a presentation for your boss.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating visualizations to aid in data exploration.
- **Statistical Tests (Chi-Square):** Utilize statistical tests for categorical variable analysis.
